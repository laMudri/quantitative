Thanks to the reviewers for their careful reading of our
submission. We have made the following changes in the light of their
comments:

- The types and summary of the judgement forms are now separated into
  their own figures instead of inlined in the text. We hope this makes
  them easier to read, and clarifies the meanings of the judgements.

- We have spelt out some more of the details of the translations
  between Barber's DILL and the Pfenning-Davies system and ours.

- Added two paragraphs to the conclusion to compare our method to
  existing techniques for formalising Linear Logic, expanded the
  comparison to Licata et al's work, and to Abel and Bernardy's ICFP
  2020 work.

- Explained the use of colour to highlight the Agda definitions and
  terms, and linked them to the GitHub repository.

- Minor grammatical and notational tweaks throughout, and fixed
  various Lemma and Figure references identified by the reviewers.
