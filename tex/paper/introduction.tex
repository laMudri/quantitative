In normal typed $\lambda$-calculi, variables may be used multiple
times, in multiple contexts, for multiple reasons, as long as the
types agree. The disciplines of linear types \cite{girard87linear} and
coeffects \cite{PetricekOM14,BrunelGMZ14,GhicaS14} refine this by
tracking variable usage. We might track how many times a variable is
used, or if it is used co-, contra-, or invariantly. Such a discipline
yields a general framework of ``context constrained computing'', where
constraints on variables in the context tell us something interesting
about the computation being performed.
% Thus we put the
% type information to work to tell us facts about programs that might
% not otherwise be apparent.

We will present work in progress on capturing the ``intensional''
properties of programs via a family of Kripke indexed relational
semantics that refines a simple set-theoretic semantics of
programs. The value of our approach lies in its generality. We can
accommodate the following examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Linear types that capture properties like ``all list
  manipulating programs are permutations''. This example uses the
  Kripke-indexing to track the collection of datums currently being
  manipulated by the program.
\item Monotonicity coeffects that track whether a program uses inputs
  co-, contra-, or in-variantly (or not at all).
\item Sensitivity typing, tracking the sensitivity of programs in
  terms of input changes. This forms the core of systems for
  differential privacy \cite{reed10distance}.
\item Information flow typing, in the style of the Dependency Core
  Calculus \cite{abadi99core}.
\end{enumerate}

The syntax and semantics we present here have been formalised in Agda:

Our main contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A rigorous statement of substitution for a substructural type system
\item A Kripke-indexed relational semantics providing strong free theorems
\item A formalisation of this work in Agda
\end{itemize}
